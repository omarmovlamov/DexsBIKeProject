              While all electric bikes are a great way to reduce your carbon
              footprint, DexsBIKe goes the extra mile. They produce zero
              emissions and last 20% longer on a single charge, which makes them
              a much more sustainable option.

              With 20 gear combinations, riding an DexsBIKe is a great way to
              get exercise. Its pedal construction provides reduced impact, so
              it's easy on your joints. And because you can use the electric
              motor to help you, you can ride for longer periods of time without
              getting tired.
